# value_for_you
Contributions to the business and you:

What are the ways that I have contributed to the businesses (non-exhaustive):
- analyzing data: this can be done through many tools (e.g. excel, SQL, BI) and python (in particular, pandas) provides another way to analyse data as it is a progamming language
- outlier / anomaly detection: provides a view of those datapoints that do not fall within the usual distribution (+- 3 standard deviation)
- time series forecasting: we do not have a crystal ball and will not accurately predict the future.  Nevertheless, with ML, we can have a baseline and then review the actual performance to identify deviations to improve the model
- customer segmentation through RFM analysis: knowing who are our best customers and who are those whom we can work on to improve revenue
- engagment in LLMs: how do my ex-bosses view performance?  Skip the reading - let NLP (e.g. sentiment analysis and text summarization) provide you with a quick snapshot
